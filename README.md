# Game-On

EARLY BETA: This version is being released to allow teachers to build their game over the summer, but is not ready for game play.  The badges, bonus loot, groups, stats panel, and clipboard are still being built.  Please visit <a href="https://gameful.me/forums/" target="_blank">the forum on Gameful.me</a> to report bugs and get the latest news.

Game-On (GO) is an educational framework that provides teachers with a vast amount of tools to create their own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification" target="_blank">gamified</a> learning system.

### Installation Requirements

Make sure to talk to your web hosting service provider about these technical requirements, if you have any doubts.

#### PHP

Make sure that your hosting service supports and maintains a PHP version of **at least** `5.3`. Ideally, every service would have updated their PHP versions to `7.1`, but that isn't a realistic assumption. If the most recent version is not an option, version `5.6` should do the trick.

In order of best scenario: `7.1` is better than `5.6`, which is better than `5.3`.

If your service does not provide a version of PHP greater than `5.3`, please be aware that there are potential compatibility issues due to the nature of the outdated software.

#### WordPress

We highly recommend keeping your WordPress installation up to date. This not only ensures that you receive all official [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) security updates and hotfixes, but you'll also receive the best experience when using GO.
