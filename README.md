### Installation Requirements

Make sure to talk to your web hosting service provider about these technical requirements, if you have any doubts.

#### PHP

Make sure that your hosting service supports and maintains a PHP version of **at least** `5.3`. Ideally, every service would have updated their PHP versions to `7.1`, but that isn't a realistic assumption. If the most recent version is not an option, version `5.6` should do the trick.

In order of best scenario: `7.1` is better than `5.6`, which is better than `5.3`.

If your service does not provide a version of PHP greater than `5.3`, please be aware that there are potential compatibility issues due to the nature of the outdated software.

#### WordPress

We highly recommend keeping your WordPress installation up to date. This not only ensures that you receive all official [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) security updates and hotfixes, but you'll also receive the best experience when using GO.
